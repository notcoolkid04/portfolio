Hello, my name is Raffy, I hope you are doing well and thank you for viewing my portfolio. I am an aspiring Data Analyst. I enrolled in Google Data Analytics course in August 2022, and that day I always dreaming about to become a data analyst. After I finish that course, I immediately learn how to use Python, Excel, Power BI, and the most important, Statistics. For me, data analyst is a never ending learning career. Technology always moving forward and so do I.

In this modern world, we are always producing data. You might be surprised to find out that in 2021, people created 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. Imagine how big is that! As a data analyst our job is to make meaningful insights about these data that we produce and I always fascinated about how data analyst help business decision more data-driven.

Thank you!
